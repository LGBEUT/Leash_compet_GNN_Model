# Leash Compet GNN Model

These are Python scripts for a GNN (Graph Neural Network) model.

## Overview
In this competition, you will develop machine learning (ML) models to predict the binding affinity of small molecules to specific protein targetsâ€”a critical step in drug development for the pharmaceutical industry. This work will pave the way for more accurate drug discovery by predicting which drug-like small molecules (chemicals) will bind to three potential protein targets.

## Details
Datasetup_train: Transforms the TrainSet SMILES into graphs and trains the GNN model.

datetest_setup_predict: Transforms the TestSet SMILES into graphs and performs predictions.

engine: Contains functions to train, test, and evaluate the model.

model_builder: Contains the GNN model.
